# jonathan.fung.dev

This repo hosts the code for my personal website at [jonathan.fung.dev](https://jonathan.fung.dev), which is built using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org).

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1. **Clone and install dependencies**

   Do the usual.

   ```shell
   git clone
   yarn install
   ```

2.  **Spin up the dev server**

    ```shell
    cd jonathan.fung.dev/
    gatsby develop
    ```

3.  **Open the source code and start editing**

    The site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `jonathan.fung.dev` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

## ðŸŽ“ Learning Gatsby

Looking for more guidance? Full documentation for Gatsby lives [on the website](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). Here are some places to start:

- **For most developers, we recommend starting with our [in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).** It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process.

- **To dive straight into code samples, head [to our documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).** In particular, check out the _Guides_, _API Reference_, and _Advanced Tutorials_ sections in the sidebar.
